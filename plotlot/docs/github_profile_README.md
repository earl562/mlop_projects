# Earl Perry

I build AI tools that solve real problems in industries I know.

Currently focused on **ML/LLMOps engineering** — taking models from notebooks to production with proper evaluation, monitoring, and deployment pipelines.

## What I'm Building

**[MangoAI](https://github.com/earl562/mangoai)** — Fine-tuned vision-language model (Qwen3-VL-8B + QLoRA) to identify Florida mango varieties from leaf photos. Full MLOps lifecycle: data collection, training with Unsloth, experiment tracking with MLflow, serving on RunPod via SGLang, FastAPI backend.

**[PlotLot](https://github.com/earl562/PlotLot)** — AI-powered real estate zoning analysis agent. Enter a property address, get maximum allowable units and investment analysis. Built with LlamaIndex, Pinecone, and OpenAI agents.

**[YT_Trans_MCP](https://github.com/earl562/YT_Trans_MCP)** — Model Context Protocol server for YouTube transcript extraction and search. Integrates with Claude Desktop for natural language transcript analysis.

**[Hadza Translation](https://github.com/earl562/Hadza_Translation)** — Working on AI-assisted preservation of Hadzane, an endangered click language spoken by ~1,000 people in Tanzania. Whisper-based transcription pipeline. [Dataset on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/earl562/Hadza_translation_dataset) (27 likes).
